# **Real-Time DevOps Monitoring Project Overview üöÄ**
## **Introduction**
Welcome to our Real-Time DevOps Monitoring Project! üåü In this endeavor, we dive into the dynamic world of monitoring and alerting, ensuring the stability and performance of our infrastructure. Let‚Äôs explore the key components that power this project.

## **Key Components** üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Prometheus Configuration**

   We‚Äôve harnessed the power of Prometheus, an open-source monitoring toolkit. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve set up:

   - Node Exporter: Collects essential system metrics from our virtual machines.
   - Blackbox Exporter: Probes endpoints (such as websites) to check availability.
   - Alert Manager: Orchestrates alerts and ensures timely notifications.

2. **Alert Rules** üö®

   Our vigilant alert rules detect critical conditions:

   - Instance Downs: Immediate alerts when virtual machines go offline.
   - Website Down: Monitors website availability and notifies us promptly.
   - Host Out of Memory: Alerts us when memory resources are critically low.
   - High CPU Load: Ensures we‚Äôre aware of excessive CPU usage.

## **Implementation Scenarios** üìä
Let‚Äôs explore the scenarios we‚Äôre monitoring:

1. **Website Monitoring**:
   - Scenario: Our website goes down or becomes unavailable.
   - Alert Trigger: When the website status changes (e.g., HTTP requests fail).
   - Alert Action: We receive an immediate notification via email. üìß
   
2. **Local Machine Service Monitoring**:
   - Scenario: A service (e.g., Node Exporter) running on a Local machine fails.
   - Alert Trigger: Service status changes (process stops, port unresponsive).
   - Alert Action: Swift email notification to address the issue.üö®
## **How Alerts Work** üö®
- **Detection**:
    - Prometheus continuously collects metrics from various sources (e.g., Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter).
    - Alert rules define conditions (e.g., CPU load > 90%, website unreachable).
    - When conditions are met, alerts are triggered.
    
- **Alerting Workflow**:
    - Alert Manager receives alerts from Prometheus.
    - It groups related alerts (e.g., multiple VMs down) and deduplicates them.
    - Alert Manager routes alerts to configured receivers (e.g., email, webhook).
    - We receive timely notifications based on severity.

# **Configuration Steps**

1. **Alert Rules Configuration:**
   - Add the [alert_rules.yml][another-file] to the Prometheus directory.
   
   [another-file]: roles/configcopy/files/alert_rules.yml
   - This file contains specific rules for alerting.

2. **Prometheus Configuration:**
   - Edit the Prometheus configuration file [prometheus.yml][another-file2]

   [another-file2]: roles/configcopy/files/prometheus.yml
     - Add the Alertmanager URL.
     - Include the rules file (`alert_rules.yml`).
     - Define job names (e.g., `NodeExporter`, `BlackBox Exporter`) under scrape configurations.
     - Ensure the website URL is configured for BlackBox Exporter.

4. **Alertmanager Configuration:**
   - In the [alertmanager.yml][another-file3], update the Gmail user ID and password according to your specific use case.

   [another-file3]: roles/configcopy/files/alertmanager.yml
     

### Deployment and Verification:

After editing these files, they should be copied to specific locations based on the instructions provided in the `tasks/main.yml` file under the `configcopy` role. By utilizing the `configcopy` role in your playbook, these changes will automatically propagate and trigger restarts of the relevant applications.

To apply the changes, run the following command:
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini configfile_playbook.yml
```
Inside the playbook, I've specified role names, like:

   - `configcopy`
     
Finally, verify that the rules and targets are correctly added/configured in the Prometheus tool.

## **Setting Up App Passwords**üîê
 ### **Why App Passwords Matter**ü§î

Before diving into the technical details, let's address the importance of app-specific passwords. If use 2-step verification for Google account, some mail clients may struggle to handle verification codes. App-specific passwords come to the rescue by allowing secure access to mail account without compromising security.

#### **Follow these steps to create an app-specific password for Google account:**

a. **Access Your Google Account:**
   - Navigate to your Google Account settings.
   - Click on "Security" in the left panel.

b. **App Passwords:**
   - Look for the "Signing in to Google" tab.
   - If you don't see the "App Passwords" option, consider the following:
     - Two-step verification might not be set up for your account.
     - Two-step verification could be configured for security keys only.
     - Your account might be associated with work, school, or another organization.
     - Advanced Protection could be enabled for your account.
   - If the option is not see, proceed to the next step.

c. **Creating an App-Specific Password:**
   - Search for "App Passwords" (you can use the search bar).
   - Sign in with your existing credentials.
   - On the "App Passwords" page, you'll find the option to create a new app-specific password.
   - Choose a descriptive name for your password (e.g., "Testing," "General Use").
   - Click "Create."
   - A unique app-specific password will be generated. Keep this secure; you won't need to remember it.

d. **Integration with AlertManager:**
   - In this project, store this app-specific password along with Gmail ID.
   - When configuring AlertManager, use this password to enable email notifications for alerts.

Remember that we will likely use this app-specific password only once during the initial setup. It ensures smooth communication between monitoring tools and Gmail account.

# **Testing the Project**

### Stopping Node Exporter

1. **Stop Node Exporter Service:**
   Execute the following command to stop the Node Exporter service:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl stop node_exporter.service
   ```

### Terminating the Boardgame Website

2. **Terminate the Boardgame Website:**
   - Press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the Boardgame website is running.
   - This will stop the website.

### Checking Alerts

3. **Verify Alerts:**
   - Check alerts under the Prometheus tool.
   - Also, review alerts in Alertmanager.
   - Alertmanager will send notifications via Gmail, which we set up and configured in the alertmanager configuration file.
   - Verify that the email notifications are received in your Gmail inbox, indicating alerts:.
     - [FIRING:1] WebsiteDown (http://localhost:8080 blackbox critical)
     - [FIRING:1] InstanceDown (localhost:9100 node_exporter critical)
     - [FIRING:1] ServiceUnavailable (localhost:9100 node_exporter critical)

## Resolving Alerts

4. **Start NodeExporter and Boardgame Website Again:**
   - For Start NodeExporter:
     ``` sh
     sudo systemctl start node_exporter.service
     ```

     For Start Boardgame Website: 
     ```sh
     java -jar ./target/database_service_project-0.0.4.jar
     ```                                  
   - Check the status in Prometheus and Alertmanager.
   - Confirm that you receive notifications via Gmail, indicating resolved alerts:
     - [RESOLVED] InstanceDown (localhost:9100 node_exporter critical)
     - [RESOLVED] ServiceUnavailable (localhost:9100 node_exporter critical)
     - [RESOLVED] WebsiteDown (http://localhost:8080 blackbox critical)
       
# **Pro Tips: Configuration Validation for Prometheus, Node Exporter and AlertManager**üîç

1. **Prometheus Configuration:**

   First, make sure you have promtool installed (usually bundled with Prometheus).
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your Prometheus configuration YAML file (prometheus.yml) is located.
Run the following command to check the configuration file:
   ```sh 
   promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
   ```
   If the configuration is valid, you‚Äôll receive a success message. Otherwise, it will highlight any issues.
   
2. **Node Exporter Configuration:**

   Similarly, ensure you have Node Exporter installed.
Navigate to the directory containing your Node Exporter configuration YAML file (node_exporter.yaml).
  
   Execute the following command to validate the configuration:
   ```sh 
   node_exporter --config.file /etc/node_exporter/node_exporter.yaml
   ```

   If everything is correct, Node Exporter will confirm successful loading. Otherwise, it will report errors.
   
3. **AlertManager Configuration:**

   For AlertManager, use the amtool utility.
Run the following command to validate your AlertManager configuration file (alertmanager.yml):
   ```sh 
   amtool check-config alertmanager.yml
   ```

   If the configuration is valid, you‚Äôre good to go. Otherwise, it will provide details on any issues.

# **Teardown**
1. Ansible Command to uninstall:
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini uninstall_playbook.yml
   ```    
    Inside the playbook, I've specified role names, so it uninstalls packages like:

   - `prometheus_uninstall`
   - `alertmanager_uninstall`
   - `nodeExp_uninstall`
   - `blackboxExp_uninstall`
   - `maven_uninstall`
   - `java_uninstall`

2. Terminate the Boardgame Website:
  - Press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the Boardgame website is running.
  - This will stop the website.
   

  #### NOTE:
   1. When uninstalling `Prometheus` and `Alertmanager` packages, there‚Äôs no need to mention the `configcopy` role explicitly. This role handles file copying, and any files it copied will automatically be removed during the uninstallation process.
